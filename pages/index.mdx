## A block of FORTRAN code:

```fortran
subroutine dijkstra(graph, start, end, path, distance)
    ! Inputs:
    ! graph - 2D array of real numbers representing the weight of the edges between nodes
    ! start - integer representing the starting node
    ! end - integer representing the ending node
    !
    ! Outputs:
    ! path - 1D array of integers representing the shortest path from start to end
    ! distance - real number representing the distance of the shortest path

    ! Pre-conditions
    assert(size(graph,1) == size(graph,2))
    assert(start > 0 .and. start <= size(graph,1))
    assert(end > 0 .and. end <= size(graph,1))

    ! Initialize variables
    integer, dimension(1:size(graph,1)) :: visited
    real, dimension(1:size(graph,1)) :: dist
    integer :: current, i, j

    ! Initialize all distances to infinity and mark all nodes as unvisited
    dist = (/( (1.0E+10), i=1,size(graph,1) /))
    visited = (/( 0, i=1,size(graph,1) /))

    ! Set the distance of the starting node to 0
    dist(start) = 0

    ! Repeat until all nodes have been visited
    do current = 1,size(graph,1)

        ! Find the unvisited node with the shortest distance
        j = 0
        do i = 1,size(graph,1)
            if (visited(i) == 0 .and. (dist(i) < dist(j) .or. j == 0)) then

        end do

        ! Mark the current node as visited
        visited(j) = 1

        ! Update the distances of the neighboring nodes
        do i = 1,size(graph,1)
            if (graph(j,i) > 0 .and. dist(i) > dist(j) + graph(j,i)) then
